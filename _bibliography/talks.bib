  abstract = {Measured data usually comes with underlying structures that can be
              exploited to improve the performance of optimization algorithms.
              These often naturally exhibit a Riemannian manifold structure,
              allowing the definition of optimization tasks in a way that
              respects the geometry of the data. For example, when dealing with
              unit-norm vectors, these can be seen as points on the unit sphere,
              which is a Riemannian manifold. More abstract examples include the
              space of rotations or positive definite matrices. This talk
              explores optimization problems that may be nonsmooth, nonconvex and
              posed on Riemannian manifolds, and strategies to solve them.},

              function. We introduce an intrinsic convex Riemannian proximal
              gradient (CRPG) method that employs the manifold proximal map for
              the nonsmooth step, without operating in the embedding or tangent

              linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems is established
              , and we derive fundamental proximal gradient inequalities that
              generalize the Euclidean case. Our numerical experiments on

@misc{MSC:2021:1,
  abstract = {Differential geometry provides a natural language for the
              development of several physical theories. Among these, the general
              theory of relativity of Albert Einstein holds a prominent place. As
              is known, the spacetime of such theory generalizes Minkowski
              spacetime and it is modeled after a pseudo-Riemannian manifold of
              dimension four that generalizes a Lorentzian space the same way a
              Riemannian manifold generalizes Euclidean space. The physical
              concept that is responsible for the transition from Minkowski
              spacetime to that of general relativity is mass, which forces the
              former to curve, in accordance to Einstein's theory. For instance,
              a body with a certain mass curves spacetime in such a way that it
              is rendered approximately flat far away from this mass, in absence
              of any other body. Even at a great distance from an isolated body,
              information about its mass can be gathered from the distortion that
              causes spacetime to differ from the flat one. More precisely, if
              $N$ is a complete spacelike hypersurface of the spacetime $(M,
              \tilde g)$, the Riemannian metric $g$ induced on it will be
              asymptotically flat. This means that, by removing a suitable
              compact subset $K$ from $N$, each connected component of $N
              \setminus K$, known as an end of $N$, is diffeomorphic to the
              complement of a ball in $R^3$ and that the metric approximates the
              Euclidean one at infinity accordingly. The ADM mass of an end,
              introduced by R. Arnowitt, S. Deser e C. Misner in the late '50s,
              turns out to be a certain coefficient in the asymptotic expansion
              of the metric at spatial infinity. The present thesis will focus on
              the discussion of the proof of the ``positive mass theorem'' as
              done by R. Schoen and S.-T. Yau in their 1979 paper ``On the Proof
              of the Positive Mass Conjecture in General Relativity''. According
              to this theorem, assuming the hypersurface $N$ to be maximal in $(M
              , \tilde g)$ and its scalar curvature to be non-negative, the ADM
              mass of each end is non-negative; furthermore, if an end has zero
              mass, then $(N,g)$ is isometric to the Euclidean space of dimension
              three. The first statement is due to an argument from minimal
              surface theory: after reducing the situation to the case of
              strictly positive scalar curvature on $N$, assuming the mass of a
              fixed end to be negative, the second variation formula together
              with the local Gauss-Bonnet theorem enable the deduction of a
              contradiction concerning the Gauss curvature of a particular
              minimal surface embedded in the manifold in question. The second
              statement is proven by means of a more analytic approach: if an end
              has zero mass and $g$ is not Ricci-flat, then by solving a certain
              elliptic problem, it is possible to prove the existence of a metric
              that is conformally equivalent to $g$, asymptotically flat,
              scalar-flat and with negative mass, in contrast to the first
              statement. Since in three dimensions the Ricci tensor is zero if
              and only if the curvature is zero, the conclusion is that $(N,g)$
              is isometric to Euclidean space if an end has null mass.},

@misc{BSC:2018:1,
  abstract = {As is known, symplectic geometry provides a natural environment
              for the study of classical mechanics in its Hamiltonian
              formulation. Fundamental ideas in physics, such as mechanical
              motions and energy, admit a formal representation in symplectic
              geometry that enables us to study their nature in depth, in terms
              of geometric objects of the likes of diffeomorphisms, vector fields
              and differential forms. For instance, motions which we are used to
              in physics are just phase fluxes generated by a vector field
              corresponding to a function called Hamiltonian of the system, that
              in physics is regarded as the energy of such system. The
              fundamental object studied in symplectic geometry is a class of
              manifolds, called symplectic manifolds, are nothing but regular
              even-dimensional differential manifolds endowed with a closed and
              non-degenerate differential $2-$form, usually referred to as $
              \omega$. By Liouville's Theorem, as is well understood, mechanical
              motions preserve phase space volume. More generally, Hamiltonian
              motions preserve the symplectic volume form of the manifold they
              exist in, which is the top exterior power of the symplectic form $
              \omega$. The goal of this paper is, in fact, to explain what
              specifies mechanical motions inside the class of all volume
              preserving transformations. More generally, what sets a specific
              class of diffeomorphisms defined on a symplectic manifold, called
              Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, apart from generic volume-preserving
              ones. One can already grasp the duality of these phenomena: from a
              geometric point of view, at least under some assumptions on the
              manifold, the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms is just the path
              connected component of the identity in the group of all symplectic
              diffeomorphisms, which in turn are diffeomorphisms that preserve
              the symplectic form $\omega$ , while from the point of view of
              classical mechanics it is the group of all possible mechanical
              motions. The pivotal theorem of this essay, that in some way
              characterizes symplectic transformations, is the so-called
              Non-squeezing Theorem, also known as the Symplectic camel Theorem,
              first proven by Mikhail L. Gromov in 1985 in his paper
              Pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds. Said theorem
              states that one cannot embed a ball into a cylinder via a
              symplectic map if the radius of the ball is greater than the radius
              of the cylinder. It can be easily seen that, in turn, one can embed
              a ball of any radius into a cylinder of any other radius via a
              generic volume-preserving map. This tells us that symplectic
              transformations are less flexible than simple volume-preserving
              diffeomorphisms. From the viewpoint of physics, in one of the
              countless application of Gromov's Theorem, this kind of rigidity
              can be seen in the generalized uncertainty relation, as shown by
              Maurice A. de Gosson in his article The symplectic egg in calssical
              and quantum mechanics. The discussion of this point, however, is
              not the goal of this presentation. The vast majority of what is
              discussed in this thesis is due to the study of Leonid
              Polterovich's ETH lectures, grouped together in his book ``The
              geometry of the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms". As a
              consequence of this fact, all ideas presented here, together with
              almost all of the proofs, are due to Polterovich. A handful of the
              most basic proofs have been worked out independently, while other
              ones were done with the help of third party books.},
